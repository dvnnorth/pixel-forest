/* 
    This script needs to get every user from Firebase and insert them into 
    the database. The User ID in the database should match the UID from Firebase
    for every user. 
    So:
        1) Get every user (including user ID from Firebase)
        2) For every user, insert a user into the database with matching 
            UID, email, first name, and last name
