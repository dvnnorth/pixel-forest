# Pixel Forest

Pixel Forest is a full-stack web application designed to let users quickly and easily upload, host, and share photos. Pixel Forest leverages Google's Firebase platform to create and authenticate users and to host and share photos. The model was developed using Sequelize, the view using Handlebars, and controller using Node and Express. A deployed version of this application can be found at [https://pixelforest.herokuapp.com](https://pixelforest.herokuapp.com)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Pixel Forest is built using Node.js and uses the Express, Firebase, Sass, and Sharp npm libraries, among others. To install the required packages, just clone the repository and use the node package manager to install all of the relevant packages.

```
npm install
node server.js
```

You must also create an application in Google's Firebase console and  generate an administrative token. This .JSON token must be stored in a folder called ``admin`` in the root directory of the application. In addition to the admin token, you must also get the configuration options from Google Firebase for your application and replace the existing ones. In addition, this application uses an ftp server to store the thumbnails generated by Sharp; you will need to set up a similar web server for you thumbnails.
